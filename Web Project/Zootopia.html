<p>"Zootopia", a fantasy set in a city where predators and prey live together in harmony, is a funny, beautifully designed kids' film with a message that it restates at every turn. But if you think about that message for longer than five minutes, it doesn't merely fall apart, it invites a reading that is almost surely contrary to the movie's seemingly enlightened spirit: discrimination is wrong, but stereotypes are stereotypes for a reason, and it's not easy for members of a despised class to overcome the reasons why the majority despises them, so you gotta be patient.</p>
