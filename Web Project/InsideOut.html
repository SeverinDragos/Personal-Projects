<p>"Inside Out", a comedy-adventure set inside the mind of an 11-year old girl, is the kind of classic that lingers in the mind after you've seen it, sparking personal associations.The best parts of it feel truly new, even as they channel previous animated classics and explore situations and feelings that everyone has experienced to some degree.</p>
<h2 id = "InsideOutPlot"><span>Plot:</span></h2>
<article>The bulk of the film is set inside the brain of young Riley, who's depressed about her mom and dad's decision to move them from Minnesota to San Francisco, separating her from her friends. Riley's emotions are determined by the interplay of five overtly "cartoonish" characters: Joy, a slender sprite-type who looks a little bit like Tinkerbell without the wings; Sadness, who's soft and blue and recessive; Fear, a scrawny, purple, bug-eyed character with question-mark posture; Disgust, who's a rich green, and has a bit of a "Mean Girls" vibe; and Anger, a flat-topped fireplug with devilish red skin and a middle-manager's nondescript slacks, fat tie and short-sleeved shirt.</article>
