<p>Carving itself a cool niche alongside Disney's very best animated output, this rip-roaring fairytale (which takes its cue from Hans Christian Andersen's The Snow Queen) has everything you want for Christmas: belting songs, soaring hearts, snappy jokes and an inspirational reworking of the traditional happy ending.</p>
<h2 id = "FrozenPlot"><span>Plot:</span></h2>
<article>Princess Elsa of Arendelle possesses magic that allows her to control and create ice and snow, often using it to play with her younger sister, Anna. Having been forced to isolate herself because of her icily magical powers, Princess Elsa shuns her sister Anna's attentions for fear that she may harm her. But when an outbreak of eternal winter sends Elsa into exile, Anna is in hot pursuit, aided by (among others) talking snowman Olaf who could give Shrek's Donkey a run for his money in the comic sidekick stakes.Reaching the ice palace, Anna meets Elsa, but when she reveals what has become of Arendelle, Elsa becomes upset, saying that she cannot undo it, and accidentally freezes Anna's heart.</article>
